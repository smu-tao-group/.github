# Tao Research Group @SMU

Welcome to the Tao Research Group in the Department of Chemistry at SMU!

Our group focuses on developing highly efficient and accurate computational methods to calculate free energy for chemical reactions and biological processes. We are also applying these novel free methods in combination of powerful computational tools, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM), to solve real world chemistry and biology problems.

You can follow us on our [Homepage](https://smu-tao-group.github.io),  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Tao-Research-Group-424893014296789/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/taogroupsmu), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wmjVxgYAAAAJ).

We are actively hiring Ph.D. students! Please see [Join Us](https://smu-tao-group.github.io/join.html) for more information.
